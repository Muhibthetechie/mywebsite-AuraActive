  Football is deeply rooted in global culture, with its origins tracing back centuries. The modern version of the game was formalized in England in the mid-19th century, with standardized rules established by The Football Association in 1863. Since then, football has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, played in nearly every country and at every level, from grassroots to professional leagues.

  The sport fosters community and national pride, as teams represent clubs, regions, or even entire countries. Major football events, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and domestic leagues like the English Premier League, attract millions of viewers globally. Iconic players, such as Pelé, Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo, have become household names due to their immense talent and contribution to the sport.
  
  Beyond the professional level, football plays a significant role in youth development and physical fitness. It encourages teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Football clubs and academies train young players, some of whom rise to professional prominence, making it a crucial part of many societies worldwide.
  
  The simplicity of the game — requiring just a ball and an open space — contributes to its widespread popularity, making it accessible to people from all walks of life.

  Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the world’s most popular sport. It is played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players, on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score by kicking or heading a ball into the opponent’s goal. A match lasts 90 minutes, split into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute break in between.

  Players, except for the goalkeeper, are not allowed to use their hands or arms to control the ball. The goalkeeper can use their hands, but only within the designated penalty area near their goal. A goal is worth one point, and the team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. If the match ends in a draw, extra time or penalty shootouts may be used to determine the winner, depending on the competition.
  
  Football is played at various levels, from amateur to professional leagues, with major international competitions like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and continental tournaments like the UEFA European Championship and Copa América. The sport emphasizes skill, strategy, teamwork, and athleticism, attracting millions of fans worldwide.
