  Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, typically consisting of 11 players each. Originating in England, it has become one of the most popular sports globally, especially in countries like India, Australia, Pakistan, and England. The game is played on a circular or oval-shaped field, with a 22-yard-long pitch at the center. Each team takes turns to bat and bowl, with the batting team aiming to score runs while the bowling team tries to restrict the runs and dismiss the batsmen.

  A match is divided into innings, during which one team bats and the other bowls and fields. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit it and score runs by running between the wickets or hitting boundaries. A boundary is scored by hitting the ball to the edge of the field, earning four or six runs depending on whether the ball bounces.
  
  Cricket has multiple formats, including Test matches (lasting up to five days), One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20), with each format offering different styles of play. Major international competitions include the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, and the Ashes series between England and Australia. Cricket is cherished for its strategy, skill, and rich tradition.

  Cricket’s appeal lies in its blend of strategy, skill, and endurance. It fosters a unique balance between individual brilliance and teamwork, with key players like batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders contributing to their team's success. Iconic cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, Don Bradman, Virat Kohli, and Ben Stokes have inspired generations of fans with their talent.

  The sport is not only about physical skill but also mental sharpness, requiring players to adapt to different game situations. Whether it’s the long, tactical nature of Test cricket or the fast-paced excitement of T20 matches, cricket captivates millions, uniting fans worldwide.
