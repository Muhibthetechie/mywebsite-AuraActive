  Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, typically consisting of 11 players each. Originating in England, it has become one of the most popular sports globally, especially in countries like India, Australia, Pakistan, and England. The game is played on a circular or oval-shaped field, with a 22-yard-long pitch at the center. Each team takes turns to bat and bowl, with the batting team aiming to score runs while the bowling team tries to restrict the runs and dismiss the batsmen.

  A match is divided into innings, during which one team bats and the other bowls and fields. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit it and score runs by running between the wickets or hitting boundaries. A boundary is scored by hitting the ball to the edge of the field, earning four or six runs depending on whether the ball bounces.
  
  Cricket has multiple formats, including Test matches (lasting up to five days), One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20), with each format offering different styles of play. Major international competitions include the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, and the Ashes series between England and Australia. Cricket is cherished for its strategy, skill, and rich tradition.

<aside class="font">

  Cricket’s appeal lies in its blend of strategy, skill, and endurance. It fosters a unique balance between individual brilliance and teamwork, with key players like batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders contributing to their team's success. Iconic cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, Don Bradman, Virat Kohli, and Ben Stokes have inspired generations of fans with their talent.

  The sport is not only about physical skill but also mental sharpness, requiring players to adapt to different game situations. Whether it’s the long, tactical nature of Test cricket or the fast-paced excitement of T20 matches, cricket captivates millions, uniting fans worldwide.

  #1: Australia (1999-2007)
  Heading into the 21st century, Australia remained far and away superior to everyone else. During this run, they managed a 16-match Test winning streak…twice! The team won the World Cup three times in a row, undefeated in their 2003 and 2007 campaigns. From trouncing a World XI in the Super Series to winning the Champions Trophy, Australia captured every piece of silverware available. Apart from the 2005 Ashes, the team largely dominated arch-rivals England, whitewashed fellow heavyweights South Africa, and overcame the “final frontier” India in 2004. Whether it was batsmen Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, or bowlers Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, the entire team was filled with legends of the game. When it comes to achieving excellence, look no further than this Australian era.

  #2: West Indies (1975-90)
For a long time, it seemed as if the West Indies would rule cricket forever. Easily winning the first two editions of the World Cup, the Windies kept their hold on the sport in both ODIs and Tests. Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, and Michael Holding were among the pace brigade that decimated batting orders with ease. Batting legends Vivian Richards, Gordon Greenidge, and Desmond Haynes piled up runs and then some, making for a team that was complete in every way. The Windies still hold the record for the longest unbeaten Test streak, remaining unconquered for a mind-boggling 15 years! Simply avoiding defeat against this team was considered a success, although few ever achieved it.

  #3: India (2016-)
  Virat Kohli’s appointment as captain in 2015 signaled India’s ongoing ascension. Kohli reestablished home conditions as an impenetrable fortress but took one step further overseas. The Indians became the first Asian side to win a Test series in Australia, repeating this feat later on. They also adapted to English conditions, representing India’s constant improvement. Although global trophies have eluded them, they generally win all the group-stage matches before an unlucky knockout defeat. Batsmen like Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill strike fear into opposition line-ups. India finally overcame bowling shortcomings with matchwinners like Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, and Kuldeep Yadav who cut through batting orders in their opening spells. Their consistency paid off when India topped the rankings in all three formats, consolidating themselves above their opponents.

  #4: Australia (1946-51)
Coming in straight after the end of WWII, Don Bradman ended his career in the best way possible. The legendary batsman continued to rack up the runs, leading a team that is now known as “The Invincibles.” Their peak saw the Australians play an entire English summer undefeated, remaining the only team to ever do so. Australia also dominated the other sides they faced, blanking New Zealand, South Africa, and India, while West Indies were handily defeated as well. This marvelous run brought cricket back to popularity in a post-war world, as crowds broke attendance match records to watch Bradman’s Invincibles in action. Although Bradman himself ended his career with a duck, the winning mentality he injected into his team continued after his retirement.
</aside>
<aside class="font">
  #5: Pakistan (1990-94)
In the ‘80s, no team seemed to challenge the mighty West Indies apart from Pakistan. The Men in Green propelled themselves in the early ‘90s, thanks to Imran Khan’s captaincy. Embracing the “cornered tigers” mentality, Khan’s men roared through global events like the Austral-Asia Cup before becoming world champions in 1992. It was an era defined by Pakistan’s bowling attack, with Khan, Waqar Younis, and Wasim Akram ruling the roost. Batting heavyweights like Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, and Inzamam-ul-Haq balanced the squad’s depth. This team carried a fearless attitude that brought a heightened level of excitement into the game. They might not have been invincible, but their daring approach enabled Pakistan to land at the top of the rankings at their peak.
